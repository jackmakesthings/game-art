return False: a game about robots, honesty, and choices. This is where I'll be keeping sketches and assets as I work on them.

Mostly sketches, a few more polished assets, for the [game I'm working on right now](https://github.com/jackmakesthings/game-dev/). Files ending in `.hxl` were made in [Hexels 2](https://www.marmoset.co/hexels), which is a really fun drawing program. Files ending in `.vox` were done with [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io), which is another really fun drawing program.
